         <h2> About our Cafe`  </h2>
            <p>
                At <span class="resort">Lava Java Cafe` </span> We source premium 100% Arabica beans grown in optimal weather 
                conditions and roast them locally at our plants. Owing to the unique flavor notes in our blends, our fresh coffee is
                in high demand among retailers and businesses within the region. <br>

                During the roasting process, we ensure that quality assurance standards are met so that we deliver great taste consistently.
                Within less than 7 days of roasting, the batch is dispatched to our stores to ensure the freshness of ground coffee is retained.
                We have a strict policy of supplying only 14 days' worth of bean stock to our stores to ensure customers receive freshly roasted coffee
                every time. <br>
                
                We source and roast coffee from single farms, estates and cooperatives. When we taste a coffee that we like, we want to know where it comes 
                from and who grows, picks and processes it. We travel extensively throughout the year, visiting the producers and cooperatives with whom we 
                currently work and looking for interesting varietals of coffee and new farms from which to buy.
                We believe that where such a relationship exists, quality, quantity and price requirements can be discussed in an open and equal way. We see this
                as sustainable, fair and equal trade.<br>
                
            </p>

        <h2> History</h2>
            <p>
              We started roasting and retailing coffee in 1978. At the beginning we roasted in the basement of our shop on Monmouth Street, Covent Garden, using
               rather old-fashioned, direct-flame machines, first a small UNO and then a 1930s Whitmee.<br>

              And now after 6 years, we have moved our roasting site again, just a little further east to Spa Terminus in Bermondsey where we have converted 
              five arches into a roasting, tasting and office space. In the new roastery we have installed two roasters from Chicopee in Massacheusets, USA. Loring 
              roasters combine air roasting technology with energy efficient design.<br>

              We also have expanded the variety of donuts and breakfast sandwiches and sides in our menu since we started with only three  variety of sandwich 
              and only one side option.
