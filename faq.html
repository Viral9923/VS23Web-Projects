        <h2> Frequently Asked Questions - Coffee</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Why do your coffees always change?</dt>
            <dd>Coffee is a seasonal product with one or in some countries two crops a year. We buy small lots from many 
                farms in each country  so when one coffee runs out, we go right on to the next one we have bought. In some
                places the farms are very small, just one or two acres, and these coffees change more frequently. 
            </dd>

          <dt>Can you grind the coffee?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, there are the usual grind options available as standard options, listed in order of coarsest to finest.
                We use our finest grinders powered by Kuerigg. 
            </dd>

          <dt>Can I get the coffee ground differently from the options you have?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we'd be happy to grind it differently for you, but you 'll need to contact us directly. Please note that it 
                is always difficult to get the perfect grind for espresso but we'll do our best. We have Original Blend, Decaf, Columbian, 
                Holiday Blend, Dark Roast and also can grind espresso but would be in less quantity compared to the others.
            </dd>

          <dt>How much coffee should I use for my brew method?</dt>
            <dd>As much as you need to enjoy your coffee. There is a lot of information available online on how best to make coffee in a
               variety of different brew methods. We recommend you try for yourself and come up with an amount that you enjoy. In our shops 
               we use 22g for a filter coffee and between 19 and 21g for espresso.
            </dd>

          <dt>Is your coffee Arabica?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. We buy from a lot of farms and they often have different varietals, but all of these varietals are Arabica.
